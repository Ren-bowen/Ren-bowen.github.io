I am currently a junior undergraduate from Tsinghua University in mathematics and applied methematics.
I am interested in computer graphics, especially in physical-based animation. I hope to use the knowlegde of methematics, physics and computer to the real world, including vedios and games. I am very fortunate to be advised by Professor [Tao Du](https://people.iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/~taodu/). 

Here is my [CV](../assets/CV.pdf), some [notes](../assets/note.pdf) and [reports](../assets/report.pdf)
