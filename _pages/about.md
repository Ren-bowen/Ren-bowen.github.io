I am currently a junior undergraduate from Tsinghua University in mathematics and applied methematics.
I am interested in computer graphics, especially in physical-based animation. I hope to use the knowlegde of methematics, physics and computer to the real world, including vedios and games. I am very fortunate to be advised by Professor Tao Du. 

Here is my CV, some notes and reports.
